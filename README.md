# Gesture-controlled-mouse-using-machine-learning
The Gesture Controlled Mouse Using Machine Learning project aims to create a hands-free computer control system that interprets human hand gestures as mouse commands. Using a webcam and computer vision techniques, the system captures real-time video input and detects hand movements to perform cursor actions such as moving, clicking, and scrolling. The project leverages Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe libraries for gesture detection and tracking, while a trained machine learning model interprets these gestures with high accuracy. This innovation enhances accessibility and provides an intuitive way to interact with computers without traditional input devices.
